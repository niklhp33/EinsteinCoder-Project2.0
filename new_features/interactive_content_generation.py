    # This is a complex feature that would likely involve:
    # - Custom video players or platform-specific interactive features (e.g., YouTube annotations, TikTok stickers).
    # - Overlaying images/text at specific timestamps (using FFmpeg's overlay filters).
    # - Potentially generating separate video segments for "branching" narratives.

    # Mock return value
    return video_path # Return original path for now

# Any other helper functions for interactive elements (e.g., UI for defining interactions) would go here.
